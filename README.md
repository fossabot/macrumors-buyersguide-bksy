# macrumors-buyersguide-bksy

A bot for Bluesky which skeets out any changes to MacRumors' Buyers Guide.

This project uses a variation of [this technique](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) to periodically scrape the [MacRumors Buyer's Guide](https://buyersguide.macrumors.com), and skeet out a post mentioning the changes (not yet implemented).
